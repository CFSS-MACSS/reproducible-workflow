# reproducible-workflow

## Part 1 - project-oriented workflow

* Have a look around the files here. Where are the R scripts? What are the directories `data` and `figs` for? Do the names and structure help you find things?
* Open each R script, finish it, and run it. Remember to restart R as you go, so you are certain each file is complete, i.e. data flows through explicit write/read, not the global workspace.
    * `R/01-write-installed-packages.R`
    * `R/02-wrangle-packages.R`
    * `R/03-barchart-packages-built.R`
